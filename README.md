My introduction to full stack web development (years old project)

My idea for the website was to have an online, live & shareable notepad - useful for individual, group, or organization use. It involved a full registration, login, security pipeline, UI/UX, database with stored procedures, and a backend that handled website logic, email sending, and DB communication.

Written with PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ajax and utilized a PHPMyAdmin database. Used to run on an Apache server, but now it is taken down vis a vis university server policy for alumnus.
